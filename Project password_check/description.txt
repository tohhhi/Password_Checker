--- Password checker ---

Libraries: requests, hashlib (Secure hashes and message digests), sys (System-specific parameters and functions)

Description: With the help of API from https://haveibeenpwned.com/ we can check if our password was exposed in data breaches. 

How it works?

From terminal we need to type python checkmypass2.py (name of folder with passwords that we want to verify); Example: python checkmypass2.py passwords.txt

How I build this script?

I knew about this site https://haveibeenpwned.com/ from a podcast and once I check my passwords and I saw the site has also an API. In my opinion is risky 
to check passwords direct on the site because someone on the web can receive your passwords. So to make it safer I acces the API with requests library to
connect. After we need to hash our passwords for security reasons.
